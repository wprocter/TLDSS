                <p>"I’m not really sure what’s going on, to be honest. Everything was working fine yesterday, and then suddenly today, the computers started freezing, and the Wi-Fi went down. I didn’t do anything unusual—just my usual tasks, like managing memberships and handling customer inquiries. I did update the gym management software like I was shown to do, but it was the same process I’ve used before. I don’t know how malware could have gotten onto the system. Maybe it was an email or something? I’ve been careful about what I click on, but you never know these days. I hope the IT team can figure it out soon because it’s making it really hard to do my job. If there’s anything I can do to help, just let me know, but I really don’t think I’ve done anything wrong."</p>
