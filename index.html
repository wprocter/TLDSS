            <h2 class="text-primary m-3 p-3">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Oakwood Leisure Centre is a multi-purpose facility in the UK, offering a variety of services including a swimming pool, gym, fitness classes, a café, and a football pitch. The centre is a popular community hub, partially funded by Oakwood Council, and provides sports and leisure activities for all age groups.</p>
            <h3 class="">History and Recent Developments</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Oakwood Leisure Centre was established in the early 1990s and has undergone several renovations to modernize its facilities. Recently, management made an unpopular decision to returf the football pitch with astro turf and reduce gym hours to close after 8 PM due to repeated incidents of inappropriate behavior. This has led to a backlash from the local sports community and an increase in online complaints. Additionally, a large number of new staff members have joined the team, and they have been using the network to access the internet and their emails, raising security concerns.</p>
