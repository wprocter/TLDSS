            <h4 class="alert-heading">Introduction</h4>
            <p>CloudVault, a data storage provider, has reported a technical disruption impacting access to certain client files. The company is working with cybersecurity experts to restore services and ensure the integrity of stored data. While investigations continue, CloudVault insists that customer security remains its top priority and that affected businesses are being kept informed.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="mb-0">As part of the review, CloudVault has engaged a cybersecurity analyst to conduct a security assessment 
                of its systems. The analyst will identify potential vulnerabilities and recommend appropriate measures to enhance 
                security. The analyst will submit a report outlining the findings and recommendations.</p>

            <h4 class="alert-heading">Overview of the situation</h4>
            <p>Fitness+, suffered a major cybersecurity breach exposing 50,000 customer records. Hackers gained access via an unpatched web application vulnerability and a series of phishing emails targeting junior staff. The compromised data includes membership details, personal information, and limited financial records, though payment details remain encrypted. The company’s cybersecurity policies were outdated, and a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) allowed unauthorized access to senior accounts.</p>
            <p>The attackers remained undetected for over six months, during which they exfiltrated HR records and planted malware that could have enabled future attacks. The company failed to notify the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) within 72 hours, potentially violating GDPR.</p>
            <p>An internal investigation revealed serious compliance failures, a lack of staff training, and third-party supplier vulnerabilities. Customers are furious, demanding compensation, and some have already launched a class-action lawsuit.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Cover Story</h4>
            <p>Fitness+ is minimizing the breach's severity, stating that only "some" customer data was accessed, and no financial data was compromised. They are framing this as an isolated incident due to a rogue third-party supplier and claiming immediate steps were taken to secure the system.</p>
            <p>Internally, however, panic is setting in. The PR team is struggling with customer backlash, the DPO (Data Protection Officer) was informed too late, and IT staff are under pressure to fix security gaps while avoiding blame.</p>
