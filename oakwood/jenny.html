                <p>"This is a critical situation, and we’re doing everything we can to contain the damage and identify the source of the malware. The challenge is that we have to work around business hours to minimize disruption to services, which limits the time we have to investigate and implement fixes. We’ve already isolated the affected systems, including the senior receptionist’s workstation, and are running forensic scans to determine how the malware was introduced. Once we have more information, we’ll need to patch vulnerabilities, update our security protocols, and possibly retrain staff on IT policies. It’s going to be a long process, but our priority is to restore functionality and ensure this doesn’t happen again."</p>
