                <p>"This situation is deeply concerning. Not only do we have a major IT issue on our hands, but we’re also facing potential reputational damage. Our customers rely on us to provide a seamless experience, and now we’re dealing with system failures that are disrupting services. I’ve already received several complaints about the Wi-Fi being down and the reception computers freezing. If word gets out that we’ve been compromised because of unauthorized software, it could seriously harm our reputation. We need to resolve this quickly, communicate transparently with our customers, and ensure this never happens again. I’m counting on the IT team to get to the bottom of this and restore normal operations as soon as possible."</p>
