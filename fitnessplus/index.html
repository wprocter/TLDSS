            <h4 class="alert-heading">Introduction</h4>
            <p>Fitness+, a leading gym and wellness provider, recently experienced a cybersecurity incident 
                affecting some of its customer records. While services remain operational, the company is conducting an 
                internal review to assess the scope of the issue. Customers have been reassured that key systems remain secure 
                and that Fitness+ is taking appropriate measures to enhance security.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="mb-0">As part of the review, Fitness+ has engaged a cybersecurity analyst to conduct a security assessment 
                of its systems. The analyst will identify potential vulnerabilities and recommend appropriate measures to enhance 
                security. The analyst will submit a report outlining the findings and recommendations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Overview of the situation</h4>
            <p>Fitness+, suffered a major cybersecurity breach exposing 50,000 customer records. Hackers gained access via an unpatched web application vulnerability and a series of phishing emails targeting junior staff. The compromised data includes membership details, personal information, and limited financial records, though payment details remain encrypted. The company’s cybersecurity policies were outdated, and a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) allowed unauthorized access to senior accounts.</p>
            <p>The attackers remained undetected for over six months, during which they exfiltrated HR records and planted malware that could have enabled future attacks. The company failed to notify the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) within 72 hours, potentially violating GDPR.</p>
            <p>An internal investigation revealed serious compliance failures, a lack of staff training, and third-party supplier vulnerabilities. Customers are furious, demanding compensation, and some have already launched a class-action lawsuit.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Cover Story</h4>
            <p>Fitness+ is minimizing the breach's severity, stating that only "some" customer data was accessed, and no financial data was compromised. They are framing this as an isolated incident due to a rogue third-party supplier and claiming immediate steps were taken to secure the system.</p>
            <p>Internally, however, panic is setting in. The PR team is struggling with customer backlash, the DPO (Data Protection Officer) was informed too late, and IT staff are under pressure to fix security gaps while avoiding blame.</p>
