                <p>""I’m not really sure what’s going on, to be honest. Everything was working fine yesterday, and then suddenly today, the computers started freezing, and the Wi-Fi went down. I didn’t do anything unusual—just my usual tasks, like managing memberships and handling customer inquiries. I did update the gym management software like I was shown to do, but the normal update source wasn’t available. I Googled the latest version, and this site called RIPSoft.ru came up. It had an unlimited version with a CD key, so I thought it must have been the right one. I didn’t think it would cause any problems—it looked legit! I don’t know how malware could have gotten onto the system. Maybe it was an email or something? I’ve been careful about what I click on, but you never know these days. I hope the IT team can figure it out soon because it’s making it really hard to do my job. If there’s anything I can do to help, just let me know, but I really don’t think I’ve done anything wrong."</p>
